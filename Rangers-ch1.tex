\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{R}escue heroes, that's who we are. We save people from the bad guys who want to beat them up and steal their money. We have a really cool headquarters that keeps us safe from the bad guys that want to find us and beat us up because bad guys like to beat up heroes.

Mechano is the biggest bad guy of them all. He is a big robot with super powers. We haven't beaten him yet because when we get close to beating him he always runs away to hide.

We have been very very busy today, there have been lots of bad guys to beat up. We have been going up and down our threaded pole with the rescue car tying up all the bad guys for the police to take to jail.

Our airplanes are fighting the bad guy pilots to keep them from blowing up the happy people. We blew up those bad guy planes before they could hurt anybody. We are really awesome and none of the bad guy planes were able to run away and hide.

What's that? Oh no! Mechano has found our headquarters! He is flying in jet plane and wants to blow up our headquarters. His minions are running at us to beat us up in our own headquarters! We have to stop them right away. Our alarm sounds, ``woo woo woo!'' and all the rescue rangers run for their battle suits and rush out the door. Our super jet is already in the air and turns right around and goes right for mechano in his bad guy plane.
